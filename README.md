 # Introduction
 This is a sample project which utilizes firebase as the real-time server. The account may be changed in the future and this does not have a full security check in place. The purpose of this project was for a job application.
 
 I didn't include the pod library as the podfile is already included, just build from there.
 
 
 # Steps in building
 1. run cocoapod `pod install`
 2. open workspace and run
 
 > The accounts use here is only temporary and will be changed eventually
